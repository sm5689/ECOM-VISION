# Fullstack Admin Dashboard Project

This project guide focuses on building a robust Admin Dashboard using the MERN stack. It's tailored for developers interested in mastering full-stack development with a particular emphasis on the backend. By integrating MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js, along with Redux Toolkit Query for state management, this project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of data modeling, efficient data fetching, and deployment strategies.

## Project Setup and Execution

### Step 1: Environment Setup
Ensure you have Node.js and MongoDB installed on your system. These are essential for running the backend and managing the database.

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies for both the frontend and backend.

```bash
# Install backend dependencies
cd backend
npm install

# Install frontend dependencies
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables
Set up your environment variables according to the `.env.example` file found in both the backend and frontend directories.

### Step 4: Run the Backend Server

```

### Step 5: Launch the Frontend Application
Open a new terminal window, navigate to the frontend directory, and start the React application.

```bash
npm start
```

After completing these steps, your Fullstack Admin Dashboard should be up and running. You can now explore its features and functionalities. This project emphasizes backend development, showcasing data modeling techniques, and provides a solid foundation for deploying full-stack applications.
